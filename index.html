        <p class="blog-post-meta">Mar 04, 2021</p>

        <p>MedC app isintended for those who are lookin for wider information on specific medicine product. By providing identification number EAN or PC which can be found on every drug package and passing it onto the app, you can obtain medicine characteristics or package laaflet for specific drug.</p>
        <p>There is two version of app for English and Polish version, however reports contains only Polish language support. This version will be optimized in the nearest future. Currently to seamlessly use it, it's nessesary to download it on your local machine, but there's no need to install it on your system. Make sure you are using Windows 10 and have firefox webbrowser installed on your local.</p>

        <p>Similarly as  missings in data, anomalies occurs very often especially while processing big data, more precisely known as 5V or 8V. These kind of observations leads to pose scores of complications in further modeling and could mislead final statistical inferences. It other words, it's impossible to create well performed statistical model or any good research without this essential step in process of analyse. Many solutions exists, it can be erased or changed but this may tamper the data. Depending of purposes of use the data choosing and applying adequate methods can be helpful, however care and precision are highly required. Some of them are based on overall assumptions, others are more specific, more depends on structure or content of the dataset and goal of diagnosis.</p>
        <p>I created an example of exploratory data analysis with one more common method and one less common of detecting outliers. This was performed on data containing Brasilian houses to rent. The map below points on cities in with the analysed offers are located.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Selected cities of Brazil</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Important to mention is, analysis was perfomed on Databrick's platform, which leveraged Spark's distributed processing power while handlling computations. All has been done in Python and a bit of Scala language. In this case, two methods i used for detecting outliers was an interquartile range and the isolation forest from sci-kit learn library. The first one is pure statistics method while IsolationForest is a tree-based model where partitions are created by first randomly selecting a feature and then selecting random value in range between minimum and maximum of that feature. Description of data exploration was performed by major steps with a little conclusion.</p>

        <p>MeteoApp it's a data dashboard that allows to track current weather information in Poland. The first and main idea was to simplified presentation of the data to show only vital indicators that everyone's using on the daily basis. Another crucial step was extend the basic data by develop statistical model, which can create forecasts on the fly. This is perform in relation to historical air temperature data in Warsaw. Forecast can be run by switching on the forecast button in the MeteApp, located under datatable. With latest update the accuracy of model prediction has been increased, thus forecast performs much better now.</p>

        <h5>Included locations and measurements</h5>
        <p>This version include selected meteorology measurements taken directly from multiple sensors installed in the seven biggest cities in Poland (Białystok, Gdańsk, Kraków, Poznań, Szczecin, Warszawa and Wrocław). The measurements parameters are as follows: </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Datetime use in the App is given for <strong> Europe / Poland timezone </strong> CET/CEST. Data comes from synoptic weather stations located in Poland, administered by Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. New measurements should be present ten minutes approximately after each hour, however once in a while some delays occurs and thus fresh measurement may not be available. To prevent missings on data, new measurement where set to be displayed 15 minutes after each hour.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A datatable contains last 24 captured measurements while main line chart on the right side presents a bit wider time horison. Parameter selectors like <em>'measurement'</em> and <em>'city'</em> has dependencies as shown in graph below.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Dependencies on measurement and city selectors</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The wind gauge react only by changing <em>'city'</em> selector value, it gives last measurement of wind speed so this measurement doesn't appear on the line chart. Better outlook of wind speed and direction gives the polar chart that shows measurements distribution of wider time horizon.</p>

        <p>Please bear in mind that forecast can be display for any weather parameters or cities but it applies only for air temperature in city of Warsaw.</P>
