        <p class="blog-post-meta">August 02, 2020</p>
        <p>While working on raw dataset some anomalies in data occures almost every time, especially with big data processing. This leads to pose scores of complications in further modelling or concluding your findings. It other words, it's impossible to create well performed statistical model by just skipping this important exploratory step. Solution comes in many different ways. The most popular is simply erase them, in some cases minor value correction may be a better operation, but cause tamper of the dataset. Investigating anomalies in dataset is often relate with choosing one methodology to detect outliers. Some of them are be based on overall assumptions, others are more specific, could be one dimensional or multivariate. It all depends on content of the dataset and the goal of diagnosis. At the beginning, the most important thing is to deeply understand structure and variables in order to find every existing anomalies or strange data patterns. After this done, finding adequate solution will be clearly much easier.</p>
        <p>I give an example of exploratory data analysis and detecting outliers based on dataset containing Brasilian houses to rent. The map below points on cities in with the houses to rent are located.</p>
        <figure class="figure image-mod1">

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Selected cities of Brazil</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This analysis was performed using Databrick's platform, which leverage Spark's distributed processing power while handles exploration of data. Python language. You will find there example of coding in Python language and IsolationForest method, which is in my opinion one of the most valuable for detecting outliers, compared to given example of interquartile rate. IsolationForest is a tree-based model where partitions are created by first randomly selecting a feature and then selecting random value in range between minimum and maximum of that feature.</p>

        <p>MeteoApp is non-commercial project which the purpose of analyse publicly shared weather data. The main idea was to simplified the presentation of weather information to show only vital indicators which everyone use on the daily basis. This app allow users to check the latest weather measurements for the biggest cities in Poland. In the second MeteoApp release I've create SARIMA statistical model that show forecast on the fly, relate to current air temperature in Warsaw. Turn on switching forecast button located under datatable and check the future temperature yourself. In relation to present evaluation phase on this feature, please do not expect best accuracy at the moment. Model will perform better in the nearest future. </p>
        <p>To open MeteoApp, tap on the upper green bar <a href=#dropdownMenu>"View projects"</a> and from appeared list choose <strong><em>MeteoApp</em></strong> section. You should get instantly redirected to the MeteoApp dashboard.</p>
        <h5>Included locations and measurements</h5>
        <p>This version include selected meteorology measurements taken directly from sensors installed in the seven biggest cities in Poland (Białystok, Gdańsk, Kraków, Poznań, Szczecin, Warszawaa and Wrocław). The measurements parameters are as follows: </p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">

        </table>
        <h5>Updates and parameters dependencies</h5>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Datetime use in the App is given for <strong> Europe / Poland timezone </strong> CET/CEST. Data comes from synoptic weather stations located in Poland, administered by Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. New measurements should be present ten minutes approximately after each hour, however once in a while some delays occurs and thus fresh measurement may not be available. To prevent missings on data, new measurement where set to be displayed 15 minutes after each hour.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The table in App contains last 24 captured measurements while main line chart on the right side presents wider time horison. Parameter selectors like <em>'measurement'</em> and <em>'city'</em> has coded dependencies as shown in graph below</p>
        <figure class="figure image-mod1">
          <img src="./assets/meteoapp/callbacks.JPG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="callbacks">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Dependencies on measurement and city selectors</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The wind gauge react only by changing <em>'city'</em> selector value, it gives last measurement of wind speed so this measurement doesn't appear on the line chart. Better outlook of wind speed and direction gives the polar chart that shows measurements distribution of wider time horizon.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Please bear in mind that this App is still in testing and development stage, some interruptions may occurs occasionally. Soon I'll add more information about new prediction model, stay tuned.</P>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">July 10, 2020 </p>

        <p>When countries ease pandemic-related restrictions that strangled their citizens everyday life for months, people rapidly and unsurely return to their workplace and social life activities. In the times of coronavirus post-outbreak some may forgot about the danger lurking around the corner as everyone is missing those normal daily life. In my country media has stopped to provides corona-brief independently if indicator of new cases is rising or dropping. How hogh is today? Do we deal with another wava of the pandemic? Well.. I encourage you to track it by yourself. Just for quick reminder, be responsible, prevent spreading the virus by wearing masks, avoid crowded and enclosed places, keep social distance at least 2 meters away from other person especially from those who are coughing, or sneezing and daily monitor the impact of infection rate in your country.</p>
        <hr>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I've created a simple web map which present <strong> daily confirmed cases reports given for each country. </strong> You'll find there indicators like: </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>daily amount of confirmed new cases,</li>
          <li>historical daily amount of confirmed new cases,</li>
          <li>number of total reported cases,</li>
          <li>total cases per million citizens,</li>
          <li>total cases of deaths.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just tap on the upper green bar <a href=#dropdownMenu>"View projects"</a> and from appeared list choose <strong><em>Covid-19 Map</em></strong> section. You should get instantly redirected to the map.</p>
        <p>All indicators are given as yesterday statistics as they are originated from each country and must have been confirmed. To view historical values of new cases click on the specific counrty marker. The most important part of data comes from Eurepean Centre for Disease and Control (ECDC). Algorithm is providing the data directly from <em>Our World in Data</em>, great organization which mission is to make data and research on the world’s largest problems understandable and accessible (read more about them <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">here</a>). The Covid-19 Map should be updated daily between 10:00 and 12:00 CEST.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I hope that you find this map helpful for tracking the indicators of current cases of Covid-19 and will contribute for overall safe and health.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta-last">July 1, 2020</p>

        <p>Finally, I managed to run up this blog. There is a bunch of useful information lurking behind the data that we can explore today from far and wide information jungle. Internet gives huge opportunity for everyone to exchange informations, the question is about the quality of that informations and reason we are using and shared them ?</p>
        <p>On <em>the Data Jungle Analysis</em> I would like to share some of my projects that I think could be valuable to use. This blog is something I thought about for a long time ago. If life and time allows in this place I will continue to:
          <ul>
            <li>share ideas</li>
            <li>share a specific project that I've been working on recently</li>
            <li>inform about implemented changes and added new features</li>
            <li>place some piece of my work i would like to share</li>
            <li>give links to article and other webpage that i find worth attention</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Anyway I hope this page will keep me motivated to constantly develop myself, gain new skills and share it with anyone.</p>
